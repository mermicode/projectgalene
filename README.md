# projectgalene
Project Galene is a series of project to help locals and tourist in the West part of Scotland to use the lifeline ferry service and local activities. As of writing this two projects exist, Galene Travel focused on ferry times and in the future integration with disruption events and Galene Places where users can get suggestions of places of interest and to visit. The former project is a on a chatbot/Alexa platform and the latter is purely Alexa based. I'm not a pro programmer but I love to learn and put my creativity and skills into practice to help people, and for free! So you may want to use this code to learn from (Use with caution lol) or you may like to contribute, if so I'd be delighted to hear from you.
